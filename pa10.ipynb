    "\n",
    "A property is a special kind of attribute that is defined using the property built-in function or the @property decorator. It allows you to define methods that are called when the attribute is accessed, modified, or deleted. These methods are called the \"getter\", \"setter\", and \"deleter\" methods, respectively. Properties are a way of creating a read-only or read-write attributes with a defined getter and/or setter methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a descriptor is an object that defines one or more of the special methods __get__(), __set__(), and __delete__() to control access to an attribute. A descriptor is a class-level attribute defined in a class definition. When an instance attribute with the same name is defined, Python checks for the descriptor. If it exists, it uses the descriptor's methods to access, set or delete the attribute, instead of the instance attribute."
